Although our game idea does not have an exact copy already exisiting on the market, there are a few games that we can compare it to in chosen aspects.

For the collecting creatures aspect, we take some inspiration from Slime Rancher from 2017. It is a very popular game on both Steam and Nintendo Switch,
with over a hundred thousand positive Steam reviews. Aside from this, collecting creatures, be it digitally or physically, has always magically drawn in
children that fit our target audience. Be it My Little Pony figurines or Pok√©mon cards, kids love collecting.

For our map design, we compare it to that of Heroes of Might and Magic III. We want a static 2D map with lots of clickable objects that will take you 
to further locations via pop-up screens with short descriptions. Heroes is from the 90s and has many different versions even today, which proves its popularity.
However, it is not targeted at the same audience and has quite different gameplay, so we have to evaluate whether this map design is suitable using different
examples as well.

Thirdly, our overall game aesthetic is somewhat inspired by Pony Friends 2, a Nintendo DS game from 2009. It has similar gameplay elements like taking care of horses,
horses having different food preferences and mini games. It is definitely aimed at the same target audience, which it reached perfectly. Although not as popular as
other Nintendo games - due to it being somewhat of a niche game - it was still regarded a success by the publisher.

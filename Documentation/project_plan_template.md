## Project Contents

### Introduction

Stellar Stables is a 2D point-and-click game designed for children aged 5-13. Set in a bright, quirky world, players explore various areas to collect various horses by solving puzzles and playing minigames. Each puzzle is unique and related to the environment they are found in.

The main goal is to discover and care for a wide variety of horses, each with its own personality and specific needs. Players manage collected horses in the stables, having to keep them happy by providing the correct food, pen decor and placing them next to preferred horses. Some rare horses unlock special abilities to help players access new areas or find even rarer horses.

The game's atmoshpere is light and whimsical, with a focus on exploration and interaction, which encourages players to engage with a lively world and the species that inhabit it.

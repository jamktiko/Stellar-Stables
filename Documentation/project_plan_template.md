## Project Contents

### Introduction

Stellar Stables is a 2D point-and-click game designed for children aged 5-13. Set in a bright, quirky world, players explore various areas to collect various horses by solving puzzles and playing minigames. Each puzzle is unique and related to the environment they are found in.

The main goal is to discover and care for a wide variety of horses, each with its own personality and specific needs. Players manage collected horses in the stables, having to keep them happy by providing the correct food, pen decor and placing them next to preferred horses. Some rare horses unlock special abilities to help players access new areas or find even rarer horses.

The game's atmoshpere is light and whimsical, with a focus on exploration and interaction, which encourages players to engage with a lively world and the species that inhabit it.

## Daily Scrum Plan

The project's weekly meeting is held on Mondays at 10:30 and Fridays at 14:30 in person at the office. During the meeting, all the finished work is checked, and the tasks for the upcoming week are planned and reviewed. Meeting minutes from each meeting will be posted in the team's Discord server.

Team members must post a short summary of the work they did at the end of each working day, including their next plans and when they plan to do it, as well as any issues that they have been facing. This keeps all team members in the loop to what everyone did on a given day.

## Communication Channels

● Team Discord Server

● Microsoft Teams

● Email

## Documentation

Team Members will have to keep track of their working hours, their daily tasks, as well as keep a learning diary of their primary roles. 

The Game Design Document is the document that will have all details related to the project and should be updated accordingly.

This page will aslo be kept up-to-date with changes in the project plan.

### Documentation Templates

The documentation must use JAMK's own other reporting template, except for the Game Design Document which will be using a GDD template instead.

### Document Control

Documents are to be stored in the team's shared OneDrive folder with access restricted to team members only. This ensures that there's a verison history, changes are documented correctly, and that backups can easily be made. Read-only access may be provided to public documents on a case-by-case basis.

Access management to team documents is primarily handled by Flavio Florovits.

## To Be Determined

There are possibilities on top of the MVP to add additional gameplay elements, including horses, areas, puzzles, and minigames to provide more content in the case time allows.
